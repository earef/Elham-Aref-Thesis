rxs map: 




It's worth mentioning that the values of throughput and success probability have been calculated theoretically, as specified in the algorithm :

\begin{lstlisting}
#define AVG_AMPDU_SIZE	16
#define AVG_PKT_SIZE	1200
\end{lstlisting}

packet size no: just aggregation of packet.(frame aggregation)



under the real capture describe mre

instead of RSSI use signal strength value
